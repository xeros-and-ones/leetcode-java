    /// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order
    /// they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
    ///

    ///
    /// Input: nums = [1,1,2]
    /// Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
